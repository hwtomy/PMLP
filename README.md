This is the project for experiment on pointwise leakage.
In data folder, data sets are stored.

In evaluation folder, evaluation function like mutual information and pearson coefficient is in the evaluation.

In function folder, there are main function for PML. In Prob, there are functions for probability calculation. 

In utility, there are functions for utility function and calculation post possibility of Py.

In v_numeration, there are algorithms for calculation V matrix and finding Py.

IN the test and experiment folder,  the test1 is the main function for experiment.
The result is in the result folder in test and experiment folder.

To run the experiment, you can run the test1.py in the test and experiment folder.
Different utility function can be chosen in mutual_opt in the utility folder.
